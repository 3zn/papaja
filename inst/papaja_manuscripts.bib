  abstract = {In the field of evaluative conditioning (EC), two opposing theories—propositional single-process theory versus dual-process theory—are currently being discussed in the literature. The present set of experiments test a crucial prediction to adjudicate between these two theories: Dual-process theory postulates that evaluative conditioning can occur without awareness of the contingency between conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US); in contrast, single-process propositional theory postulates that EC requires CS-US contingency awareness. In a set of three studies, we experimentally manipulate contingency awareness by presenting the CSs very briefly, thereby rendering it unlikely to be processed consciously. We address potential issues with previous studies on EC with subliminal or near-threshold CSs that limited their interpretation. Across two experiments, we consistently found an EC effect for CSs presented for 1000 ms and consistently failed to find an EC effect for briefly presented CSs. In a third pre-registered experiment, we again found evidence for an EC effect with CSs presented for 1000 ms, and we found some indication for an EC effect for CSs presented for 20 ms.},

  abstract = {Two studies investigated whether evaluative conditioning (EC) is modulated by pairing schedule (simultaneous vs. sequential) and by the nature of the orienting task. We tested the prediction that simultaneous (but not sequential) EC is obtained without awareness, and whether this modulatory effect supports dual-process theories of attitude acquisition. Results replicated the finding of a simultaneous EC effect in the absence of unconditioned stimulus (US) identity memory; in contrast, sequential EC effects depended on the presence of US identity memory. Yet, both EC effects were larger in the presence than in the absence of US identity memory and depended on the presence of US valence memory. Whereas the findings are consistent with dual learning processes, they can also be accounted for by a single learning process. Conceptual, theoretical, and methodological requirements for distinguishing between single- and dual-process models of EC are discussed.},

  abstract = {Previous research has claimed that evaluative conditioning (EC) effects may obtain in the absence of perceptual identification of conditioned stimuli (CSs). A recent meta-analysis suggested similar effect sizes for supra- and subliminal CSs, but this was based on a small body of evidence (k = 8 studies; Hofmann, De Houwer, Perugini, Baeyens, \& Crombez, 2010). We critically discuss this prior evidence, and then report and discuss 6 experimental studies that investigate EC effects for briefly presented CSs using more stringent methods. Across these studies, we varied CS duration, the presence or absence of masking, the presence or absence of a CS identification check, CS material, and the instructions communicated to participants. EC effects for longer-duration CSs were modulated by attention to the CS–US pairing. Across studies, we were consistently unable to obtain EC for briefly presented CSs. In most studies, this pattern was observed despite above-chance perceptual identification of the CSs. A meta-analysis conducted across the 27 experimental conditions supported the null hypothesis of no EC for perceptually unidentified CSs. We conclude that EC effects for briefly presented and masked CSs are either not robust, are very small, or are limited to specific conditions that remain to be identified (or any combination of these).
